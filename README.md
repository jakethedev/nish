noish: Nodejs Github Issue Viewer

Sometimes you just need to know which issue number you&#39;re closing, or what needs to be done today. This one-thing-and-one-thing-only tool solves that problem

Work in progress: this is nearly MVP, and will soon have bells and whistles to make it really useful. Since lots of people have node installed and use github, I hope this little guy helps someone out someday.
